# Background-Subtraction-through-Dynamic-Mode-Decomposition
This project presents an analysis of the dynamics of a mechanical system consist- ing of a ball rolling along a specially-designed landscape, which simulates the two-bounce resonance of solitary wave collisions [1]. We utilize dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) to extract underlying modes and demonstrate that DMD is effective in subtracting the background from the data and identifying the movement and motion of objects within the video. The results of the study highlight the potential of DMD as a useful tool for analyzing complex mechanical systems.
